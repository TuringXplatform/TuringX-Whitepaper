# Dynex: A scalable and reliable platform for computing beyond Moore’s law

DynexSolve is the proprietary mining algorithm that addresses real-life computational tasks BY applying Proof-of-useful-Work (PoUW) throughout the mining process. Dynex represents a cutting-edge neuromorphic computing platform, built upon a revolutionary adaptable blockchain system. Comprising of collaborating miners, this decentralized neuromorphic supercomputing network excels in executing calculations with unparalleled speed and efficiency, surpassing quantum computing limitations.

Instead of brute-forcing random hashes, DynexSolve proof-of-useful-work (PoUW) enables customers to access the combined computing power of thousands of GPUs through Python.

Though the past few decades have seen explosive growth in the computational power of silicone - computers are beginning to reach the limit of what is possible on a single chip. Some suggest quantom computing as a possible solution for this developmental bottleneck - however, in reality, quantom computing appears to be far away from real-world applications.

The Dynex platform can solve this problem in today's world, with the real-life use of the decentralized Neuromorphic chip. Dynex can achieve this by using a network of decentralized hosts and miners that are contributing to the power of the cloud-based Neuromorphic chip - which can then be offered to those who need computing power on demand (such as for AI and other applications like government and military.) 

This makes Dynex different than other traditional cryptos there is not only the decentralized blockchain ledger ensuring transactions are secure - but also includes another layer of "useful-work" unique to the Dynex platform. Due to the availability of hardware and decentralized miners globally, we believe that Dynex can achieve computational output even greater than that of quantum computing.

## Abstract

With the end of Moore’s law approaching and Dennard scaling ending, the computing community is increasingly looking at new technologies to enable continued performance improvements. A neuromorphic computer is a "Non Von Neumann" computer whose structure and function are inspired by biology and physics. Today, such systems can be built and operated using existing technology, even at scale, and are capable of outperforming current quantum computers.

Dynex is a next-generation platform for neuromorphic computing based on a new flexible blockchain protocol. It is designed for the development of software applications and algorithms that utilize neuromorphic hardware and are capable of accelerating computation. To accomplish this goal, the platform connects hosts that are running clusters of neuromorphic chips with users and applications that utilize this next-generation hardware. On the Dynex platform, computation time is exchanged for the Dynex native token.

Dynex has also developed a proprietary circuit design, the Dynex Neuromorphic Chip, that complements the Dynex ecosystem and turns any modern field programmable gate array (FPGA) based chip into a neuromorphic computing chip that can perform orders of magnitude faster than classical or quantum methodologies for a wide range of applications. Due to the dominance of ASICs in the proof-of-work token mining industry, there is a large amount of dormant FPGA infrastructure available which can be converted into high performance next-generation neuromorphic computing clusters.
